    <h1>Homework 8 - Olivia Dagenhart</h1>
    <h2>Research Question: What rivers in NC are within 5 miles of a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO)? </h2>
    <h3>Background: CAFOs are large-scale agricultural facilities that raise animals for the purpose of consumption. North Carolina and Iowa are known for having a large amount of these operations. CAFOs pollute both the air and nearby water sources. They emit greenhouse gases, and can dicharge manure and other pollutants into surface water. Although there are regulations that decrease pollution, water quality problems in surrounding areas are still common.     </h3>
